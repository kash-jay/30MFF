# 30MMF

## Description
This website is designed to give users a few tips on time managment, especially for its target audience, college students who often struggle with it. The central piece of the website is a humorous video created in class as part of the 30MFF challenge, which involved fully making a 1 minute film in 30 minutes. The website has a humorous theme while trying to educate and give users advice at the same time.

## Process
### Video
The video was uploaded to YouTube and an iframe was used to show it on the website.
### Colors
Black was used as the background to the section with the title and the video to give it more of a cinematic feeling. The section with tips used a light background and each tip is associated with a color, for example the Reward Yourself tip was given yellow to be associated with feelings of happiness.
### Animations
Most animations were achieved using some JavaScript. The scroll animations used windowHeight and getBoundingClientRect() to calculate when the animations would trigger.
Other simpler animations used CSS and most of them used 'transition: all' and 'ease' to smoothen them out.
Overall, the animations were used to give the website a smoother feeling just to improve user experience. 

## Evaluation
Overall, I think I met my expectations in this project. I ended up adding a few elements to my wireframe, which I otherwise stuck to throughout the development of this project. If I could go back and change my project, I would probably find a way to link the 30MFF video to a product or service, and I would change the website to one that is selling the product, instead of having created an informational website.
